## Project Context for Agents

When invoking agents, they should know:
- **Stack**: Next.js + Supabase + shadcn/ui + Zustand
- **Multi-tenancy**: Every query needs tenant_id isolation
- **Localization**: Hebrew (RTL) and English support required
- **Scale**: Must support 10-10,000+ clients per tenant
- **Compliance**: Israeli tax laws, 9-digit tax IDs
- **White-label**: Support for customizable branding per tenant

## Best Practices

1. Always provide specific context about your current task
2. Include relevant file paths when asking for reviews
3. Specify performance requirements (e.g., "must load in <2s")
4. Mention any Israeli regulatory requirements
5. Indicate if white-label customization is needed

## Integration with CLAUDE.md

These agents work alongside your project's CLAUDE.md file. Use agents for specialized tasks while following the general guidelines in CLAUDE.md for project conventions.
